# Rewin: A Firefox Extension

> This is a Firefox extension that restores tabs and windows, including their
> history. Making *everything* restorable. Forever.
>
> Rewin is to *win again,* or *win back.* Or maybe its rewin*d* without the
> *d?* Also, it *wins windows.*

# The Source Files

Below is the are files needed to run the Firefox extension.---As of now the
extension still does not implement even basic functionality, so I can't really
recommend that you download it (yet). However, if you really want to, you're
welcome to try it out. :)

# Milestones

<ul>
  <li>**Version 0.1: *Basic Functionality***---Like browser's "History ›
  Recently closed tabs" but regardless of age. Requires:
  <ul style="margin-top:.5rem;margin-bottom:.5rem;margin-left:2rem">
    <li>[~~A data structure~~](#internal-data-structure) (DONE)
    <li>~~Design popup menu~~ (DONE)
    <li>[Continuous history saving] (while browsing)
    <li>History menu
    <li>Restore tab function
  </ul>
  Because of browser limitations the history of restored windows and tabs won't
  visible under the usual "Back" (←) and "Forward" (→) buttons, but instead via
  Rewin's own menu. (A future workaround for this problem might be possible,
  but won't be included in version 1.)</ul>


* **Version 0.2: *Restore Window***
* **Version 1.0: *[Browser Restart]***


## Later

* Scan existing history of a tab (on extension install)
* Bifurcating history (going back, then forward different route)
* Save history externally
* Syncing history
* Work on mobile (for sync between mobile & computer)


## Far Future

* Populate [the browser's own history menu][browser history menu]
* Thumbs up/down
* History exploration


# Internal Data Structure

Persistent data is stored in `storage.local`, data that can be reconstructed on
restart is stored as global variables in `rewin-background.js`.

The `storage.local` contains key/value data of three different types:
[tabs](#tab-records), [windows](#window-records), and
[favicons](#favicon-records). The key names for each of these consist of a
single character indicating type, followed by a random string. Types are:

* `f` for favicons (below called `REFAVID`)
* `t` for tabs (`RETABID`)
* `w` for windows (`REWINID`)

```
fM-5PcX-JwI0e   // REFAVID
tv43V9nI9SjqZ   // RETABID
whE_6oklAha-v   // REWINID
```


## Random Strings

The random component of each Rewin ID is a 12 character string. (Like a Youtube
ID, but with [one more character](https://youtu.be/gocwRvLhDf8?t=289).) This
string encodes a random value using websafe base64, which contain 72 bits
(9 bytes) of entropy. (Meaning that there are 4,722,366,482,869,645,213,696
possible unique IDs.) To reach a 50% likelihood of collision, about 80.9
billion stored entries are needed (creating one new entry every second, that
would take *2,564 years* to reach). Nontheless, Rewin checks to avoid
collisions when creating new IDs.


## Favicon Records

A *favicon record* (stored in `storage.local`) consists of a single chunk of
binary data: A favicon image. (It is the simplest of the Rewin records).---Its
`REFAVID` starts with `f` followed by a [random string](#random-strings) (e.g.
`faH-SDe__6Jy0`).

```
'f<REFAVID>': <BINARY DATA>
```

Favicons are used (together with the URL and title of web pages) when showing
history entries in Rewin's menus. Since they are shown in text-based menus,
only the smallish 16×16 pixel size is ever used.

(In the future, the storing of these icons may be optimized for size. Possible
optimizations include: Throwing away unused data found in most favicons by
discarding all non-16×16 pixel sizes. Converting the bitmap to PNG and optimize
that---similar to what the command `optipng` does. Using bitmap-based checksum
as a `REFAVID` value, rather than a random number, to avoid duplicate storing
of favicons that look the same.)


## Tab Records

A *tab record* (stored in `storage.local`) consists of a list of: One *metadata
entry* (`META`) related to the tab, plus zero or more *history entries* (in
chronological order) associated with that tab.---It's `RETABID` starts with `t`
followed by a [random string](#random-strings) (e.g. `tTPwPnlus64ND`).

```
't<RETABID>': [
  META,                             // metadata entry
  [URL, TITLE, REFAVID, DATETIME],  // 1st history entry
  [URL, TITLE, REFAVID, DATETIME],  // 2nd history entry
  ...                               // etc.
]
```

The first (zeroth) entry in the list (`META`) is an object containing metadata
for the tab. Possible metadata properties are:

* `closed` (`DATETIME`)---Tab is closed. (Whenever present, it should be set to
  the `DATETIME` when the tab was closed). NOTA BENE: When a window is closed,
  the tabs in that window are *not* set to `closed`---this is by design (so
  that opened tabs can be restored when window is restored).
* `pos` (integer)---Current position in history. If unset, the last entry is
  the current entry. If `1` the first entry is the current history item (and
  all history is in the future). (In the future, with bifurcating history, this
  may be a list of integers when indicating a position in a bifurcated
  position.)

Each history entry is an array that contains:

* `URL`---The full address of the loaded page (after possible redirects).
  Includes URL parameters and hash fragment.
* `TITLE`---Page title (`document.title`) for the loaded page.
* `REFAVID`---The ID of the favicon for the page.
* `DATETIME`---Unix epoch time when page was loaded. (In the future, this might
  be replaced with a list of load times.)


### Mapping `tabId`

The following mapping table is used to convert the browser's numerical `tabId`
to the Rewin's alphanumeric `RETABID` (beginning with `'t'`) that is used for
`storage.local`.

These mapping values are only available for currently open tabs (as closed tabs
do not have a browser `tabId`), they are stored in a variable in
`rewin-background.js`, and are never saved to disk. On (browser or extension)
restart, and when previously closed windows are reopened, a new mapping is
created from new browser `tabId` to the (unchanged) `RETABID`.

```
let tabMap = {
    TABID: RETABID,
    ...
}
```

To get the current data for a tab with browser `tabId`:

```
browser.storage.local.get(tabMap[tabId])
  .then(onGet, onErr)
```


### Tab Actions

| When                    | Change                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Scan tab's history      | Create & populate tab record(s)        |
| Navigate to new page    | Add one tab entry at end of tab record |
| Navigate in history     | Update metadata `pos` of tab record    |
| Tab created             | Create new empty tab record            |
| Tab closed              | Set metadata `closed` to current time  |
| Tab restored            | Remove metadata `closed`               |

No other operations affect the tab values. **Nota bene:** Closing a window does
not change any tab values, and closing a tab only updates the tab's metadata
(it does not affect the window). However, if a tab is dragged from one window
into another, that tab *is removed* from the original window and inserted into
the new one.

The reason for closed tabs being kept in-place, is so that they can be restored
them in the same position if need be. The handling of a great many tabs (in the
thousands, if not tens of thousands) shouldn't be a problem for Javascript, and
that number of tabs are unlikely to accumulate throughout a window's lifetime.


## Window Records

A *window record* (stored in `storage.local`) contains a list of: One *metadata
entry* (`META`) related to the window, plus references to one or more tab
records (`RETABID`) for the tabs (both open and closed) associated with that
window.---Its `REWINID` starts with `w` followed by a [random
string](#random-strings) (e.g. `wBpzPFRs-8XtH`).

All recorded windows (whether open or closed) has a window record:

```
'w<REWINID>': [
  META,           // metadata entry
  RETABID,        // 1st tab id reference
  RETABID,        // 2nd tab id reference
  ...             // etc.
]
```

The first (zeroth) entry in the list (`META`) is an object containing metadata
for the window. Possible metadata properties are:

* `closed` (`DATETIME`)---Window is closed (unset for open windows, or set to
  the `DATETIME` when the tab was closed). NOTA BENE: When a window is closed,
  the tabs in that window are *not* set to `closed`---this is by design (so
  that opened tabs can be restored when window is restored).
* `incognito` (Boolean)---If set, indicate the given window was/is in incognito
  mode.
* `pos` (integer)---The currently selected tab.

There are also two special records called `'open'` and `'closed'` (literal
strings) which lists the `REWINID` numbers of the currently closed and
currently open windows, respectively.

```
'open'  : [REWINID, REWINID, ...]
'closed': [REWINID, REWINID, ...]
```

(In the future, the literal `'open'` and `'closed'` may be followed by a
number, so that the first thousand [or whatever number] closed windows are
listed under `'closed'`, and the next set of windows under `'closed1'`
etc.---The idea being that the names be predictable so they may fetched without
having to scan the entirety of `storage.local`.)


### Mapping `windowId`

The following mapping table is used to convert the browser's numerical
`windowId` to the Rewin's alphanumeric `REWINID` (beginning with `'w'`) that is
used for `storage.local`.

These mapping values are only available for currently open windows (as closed
windows do not have a browser `windowId`), they are stored in a variable in
`rewin-background.js`, and are never saved to disk. On (browser or extension)
restart, and when previously closed tabs are reopened, a new mapping is
created from new browser `windowId` to the (unchanged) `REWINID`.

```
let winMap = {
    WINDOWID: REWINID,
    ...
}
```

To get the current for a window with browser `windowId`:

```
browser.storage.local.get(winMap[windowId])
  .then(onGet, onErr)
```


### Window Actions

| When                      | Change                                   |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Scan window's history     | Create & populate window & tab record(s) |
| Window created            | Create window tab, and add to `'open'`   |
| Window closed             | Move window tab, `'open'` → `'closed'`   |
| Window restored           | Move window tab, `'closed'` → `'open'`   |
| Tab created               | Add tab ID to window record              |
| Tab moved within window   | Change tab position in window record     |
| Tab moved between windows | Remove from window, add in other window  |

No other operations affect the window values. **Nota bene:** Closing a window
does not change any tab values, and closing a tab only updates the tab's
metadata (it does not affect the window). However, if a tab is dragged from one
window into another, it's removed from the original window.


## Fake History Entries

The current approach to restoring history entries involves faking them. This is
because the entries are created by means of `history.pushState()`, which
requires that each inserted history item share the same [origin] (that is, the
same *protocol* and *domain*) as page currently loaded when `pushState()` is
invoked.

As a workaround, these (fake) history items are given URL parameters which
specify the URL that should actually be loaded (`rewin_url`), and a random
string (`rewin`) which guarantees that each URL is unique (as `pushState()`
will fail to insert an URL that is already present elsewhere in the history).

When the user then navigates to one of the fake entries, the page is reloaded
using the correct URL. This document reload is performed by a content script,
and this content script keeps track of any remaining, not-yet-reloaded history
entries. As these history entries are visited they are removed from the
internal state of the content script, and if all of the fake entries are
visited, then content script quietly exits (its job done).

This info is recreated when a tab is restored, and cleared when the tab is
closed.

```
let histMap = {
  TABID: {
    FAKEID: URL,
    ...
  }
}
```

In the future, history *might* be populated with `tabs.update()`, in which case
these fake history entries will not be needed.


[Continuous History Saving]: #continuous-history-saving
# Continuous History Saving

Rewin monitors user page navigation, and whenever a page is added or updated in
history (through navigation, or Javascript `replaceState()` or `pushState()`)
that page is recorded in Rewin's history as well.

Here we'll use the [webNavigation API] and its `onCommitted`,
`onHistoryStateUpdated` and `onReferenceFragmentUpdated` events to listen for
user navigation.

```
browser.webNavigation.onCommitted.addListener(evt => {
  ...
})
```

Also, we'll need to be able to detect when the user is navigating using history
by testing whether `webNavigation.TransitionQualifier` is `'forward_back'`.




## User Navigation Types

`webNavigation.TransitionQualifier` `"from_address_bar"` and
`webNavigation.TransitionType` `"typed"`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between `webNavigation.TransitionQualifier === "from_address_bar"`
and `webNavigation.TransitionType === "typed"`.

* `TransitionType === 'typed'` indicates how navigation started. User *typed* a
  URL directly into the address bar.
* `TransitionQualifier === 'from_address_bar'` indicates extra detail.
  Navigation originated *from* the address bar, regardless of how (typed,
  search, or history dropdown).

**Key Takeaway:** If it's `typed`, it's also `from_address_bar`. But if it's
`from_address_bar`, it's not necessarily `typed` (could be a search, or
selecting a history item from the address bar dropdown).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When `TransitionQualifier === 'from_address_bar'` the following
`TransitionType` values are possible in the `webNavigation.onCommitted` event:

The key is that `from_address_bar` is a **qualifier** that specifies *where the
navigation originated*, while `transitionType` tells you *what kind of
navigation* it was.

* `typed`: This is the most common and direct combination. The user explicitly
  typed a URL into the address bar and pressed Enter, or selected a direct URL
  suggestion from the address bar's dropdown.
* `generated`: This occurs when the user starts typing in the address bar, and
  then clicks on a suggested entry that is **not a direct URL**. This often
  happens with search queries (e.g., typing "weather" and then the browser
  generates a search URL like `google.com/search?q=weather`). Even though a
  search query was entered, the navigation originated *from* the address bar.
* `auto_bookmark`: If the user selects a bookmark from the address bar's
  autocomplete suggestions (or perhaps a history item that was originally a
  bookmark), the `transitionType` could be `auto_bookmark`, while the
  `transitionQualifiers` would include `from_address_bar` because the action
  started there.
* `reload`: If the user reloads the page by pressing Enter in the address bar
  (after the URL is already there), the `transitionType` would be `reload`, and
  `transitionQualifiers` would include `from_address_bar`. This also applies to
  session restore or reopening closed tabs, where the navigation is treated as
  a reload originating from the address bar's context.

---

In summary:

* `typed` is the most direct consequence of using the address bar to navigate to a specific URL.
* `generated` covers using the address bar for searches.
* `auto_bookmark` covers using the address bar to select a bookmark.
* `reload` covers re-submitting the current URL from the address bar.



# Problems

[Browser Restart]: #browser-restart
## Browser Restart

On browser restart, all existing windows and tabs need to be re-associated with
their Rewin history records.

Here's a [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14518800/351162)
discussing how to do this in Chrome (but it is applicable to Firefox as well):

> Tabs can be (almost) uniquely and consistently identified as
> required by the question by maintaining a register of tabs which stores the
> following combination of variables in local persistent storage:
>
> - `Tab.id`
> - `Tab.index`
> - A 'fingerprint' of the document open in the tab - `[location.href, document.referrer, history.length]`
>
> These variables can be tracked and stored in the registry using listeners on
> a combination of the following events: `onUpdated` / `onCreated` / `onMoved`
> / `onDetached` / `onAttached` / `onRemoved` / `onReplaced`

## Detecting History Navigation

In order to maintain it's internal history records, Rewin needs to be able to
distinguish when the user navigates by following a link, from when history is
used to navigate.

The [webNavigation API] can be used to figure out what kind of user interaction
was used to navigate to a new URL.

With `webNavigation.TransitionQualifier` `'forward_back'`


[Browser History Menu]: #browser-history-menu
## Browser History Menu

Functions used to populate a tab's browser history *only sometimes* affect the
history menus of the "Back" (←) and "Forward" (→) buttons in the browser.
However, this is not the programmatic view---from inside the extension,
updating the history works just fine---it is just the state is not shown in the
browser menus.

What's even more frustrating is that the above is *not always the case.* I've
tried to figure out what causes the weird behavior, thinking that it might be
tied to Firefox's [features gated by user activation], or the limitation for
[when popstate is sent] that suppresses popstate events if the user haven't yet
interacted with the tab in question, however, this does not seem to be the
case.---Or, if it is, then that is only part of the story.


### When it Works

The browser `history` state seems to always be consistent from inside
Javascript. Loading a new page, or using `pushState()` always increases
`history.length` by one, regardless of whether an entry is added to the Back
button menu or not, and the navigation methods (`back()`, `forward()` and
`go()`) always take you to the place you expect, regardless of whether that
history entry is visible in the browser menu or not.

I *think* the above is true regardless of what method is used to navigate,
though I have mostly experimented using `pushState()`---but it seems to me that
navigation based on `location` or `browser.tabs` have demonstrated the same
behavior.

In the instances I have been able to update the Back button menus, this has
always been triggered by user interaction. For example, displaying a button on
the web page itself, and have that call a function that does repeated
`pushState()` *sometimes* work to update browser Back button menu, but
sometimes not. When updating the history state from an extension, or directly
on page load, however, I have never been able to get the browser menu to
change.—It's also interesting to note that this does not seem related to the
speed with which the updates are done, using `setTimeout()` to space out the
`pushState()` invocations does not seem to affect the result one way or the
other.

Actually, that's not *entirely* true. When using `setTimeout()` and adding
history events with a long delay, the *current page* is always included in the
menu, and if the user opens the menu that current page is retained in the menu,
even after the text page is loaded. Lets say I have a Javascript that uses
`pushState()` to update the history menu with a 10 second interval. First I
load page A, this page will then be visible in the Back button menu until page
B is loaded, whereupon page B is visible in the menu until page C is loaded
(and so on). *However,* if the user happen to open the menu while (say) page B
was loaded (and then closed the menu again, without clicking any of the entries
therein) then the menu entry for page B will be retained, even after page C, D
and E have been loaded. Thus, the current page, plus any page that was loaded
when the user opened the menu will be retained in the menu.


### Restoring History

Currently, the tab history is populated with "fake" history events, which is
then loaded for real (by a content script) when a user navigate to that history
entry. The reason for this is that `history.pushState()` is used to populate
the history, and it can only be used for URLs with the same [origin] as the
current page (that is, URLs that have the same *protocol* and *domain*).

This means that history entries that have been restored by Rewin does not
contain "true" content, but a state that refers to the actual URL, and only
when the user navigates to one of these history entries, is the true content
loaded (by means of `location.replace()`).

<p><p>Different ways of loading adding an entry to history:

* [History API]---Use `pushState()` create fake history entries, then use
  content script to load the real page when user navigates to the entry.
* [Tabs API] (for browser extensions)---Use `create()` and `update()`
  methods are able to load arbitrary addresses.
* [Window location property]---Use its `assign()` or `replace()` methods.
* Link injection (insert a link into the DOM, then click it).
* Form injection (same as above, but use a form instead).
* [Proxy API]---I don't know if this is suitable. Also, it's incompatible with
  the corresponding Chrome API, so maybe avoid on the grounds that it'll make
  it harder to make a Chrome extension in the future?



# Afterword

There are so many ways one can go with this, and I'm trying not to let my
fantastical wishes run too wild.

Sometime in the future I'd like to be able to "see my own trail" across the
internet, so that if I ever revisit a web page there'll be some visual
indicator in the browser showing that I've been there before.---From there I'd
like to be able to explore the context of my previous visit, see where I came
from last I was there, see what other tabs where open at that time, and be able
to explore my past history.

Maybe even be able to leave some notes to my future self? Or at least leave
myself a thumbs up/thumbs down---indicating to my future self whether or not I
found the page useful. (I imagine a thumbs up/thumbs down emoji would replace
the current bookmark star, in the Firefox URL bar---and in practice, I'm
thinking this would just be two bookmark folders, likewise named thumbs
up/thumbs down.)

## Alternative Tab Interfaces

<div class=hanging>

[Lossless Web Navigation with Trails]---Argues that when link is opened in a
  new tab (or window) it should to retain all its history (as if 'Duplicate
  Tab' was clicked first). Each tab thus would have its own "trail" through the
  history, some of which would be shared with other tabs.
