# Rewin: A Firefox Extension

> This is a Firefox extension that restores tabs and windows, including their
> history. Making *everything* restorable. Forever.
>
> Rewin is to *win again,* or *win back.* Or maybe its rewin*d* without the
> *d?* Also, it *wins windows.*

<toc heading=Contents class=toc>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Milestones

<ul>
  <li>**Version 0.1: *Basic Functionality***---Like browser's "History ›
  Recently closed tabs" but regardless of age. Requires:
  <ul style="margin-top:.5rem;margin-bottom:.5rem;margin-left:2rem">
    <li>[A data structure](#internal-data-structure)
    <li>[Continuous saving of history] (while browsing)
    <li>History menu
    <li>Restore tab function
  </ul>
  Because of browser limitations the history of restored windows and tabs won't
  visible under the usual "Back" (←) and "Forward" (→) buttons, but instead via
  Rewin's own menu. (A future workaround for this problem might be possible,
  but won't be included in version 1.)</ul>


* **Version 0.2: *Restore Window***
* **Version 1.0: *[Browser Restart]***


## Later

* Scan existing history of a tab (on extension install)
* Bifurcating history (going back, then forward different route)
* Save history externally
* Syncing history
* Work on mobile (for sync between mobile & computer)


## Far Future

* Populate [browser history menu]
* Thumbs up/down
* History exploration


# Internal Data Structure


## `storage.local`

FIXME: Account for a tab having *future* history!

<p><p>Tabs aren't removed from their windows when closed, but only get their
tab metadata set to 'closed'---that way we can restore them in the same
position if need be. (Having several thousand tabs shouldn't be a problem, and
in reality shouldn't really happen). However, if a tab is dragged into another
window, it's removed from the original window.

```
"open": [
  [META, TABID, TABID, ...],  // a window
  ...
]
"closed": [
  [META, TABID, TABID, ...],  // a window
  ...
]
```

And for each tab we have:

```
TABID: [
  DATETIME,        // 0 or time when closed
  [URL, DATETIME],
  [URL, DATETIME],
]
```

The `TABID`s used above are our own, they do not correspond to the `tab.id`
used by the browser. (If they did we'd have a heck of a time to rename them on
when the browser restarts and all the tab IDs are reset.)


## `storage.session`

Contains the currently active fake history entries for a tab. As they are
visited (and their pages loaded for real), they are removed from here, if all
are removed then the extension stops running a content script for that tab.
This info is recreated from scratch when the tab is restored, and cleared when
the tab is closed.

```
TABID: {
  FAKEID: URL,
  …
}
```

Each unvisited (fake) history entry has an URL parameter "?rewin=FAKEID" which identifies the URL to go to. (There's a random string here to guarantee that each  URL is unique as `pushState()` doesn't allow repeated URLs.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



```
// Closed tab should stay associated with its window (but noted as closed)
//
// A closed window should be retained (tabs open at closing time should be
// marked as 'open', those closed before the closing of the window should
// be marked as 'closed'.)

windows = [
  winID: [tabId1, tabId2, tabId3, ...],
]

// Needs to allow for trees.
history = [
  tabId1: [
    {
      date: "2025-06-03T23:07:51+02:00",
      url : "http://zrajm.org/rewin/"
    }
]
```


[Continuous Saving of History]: #continuous-saving-of-history
# Continuous Saving of History

Rewin monitors user page navigation, and whenever a page is added or updated in
history (through navigation, or Javascript `replaceState()` or `pushState()`)
that page is recorded in Rewin's history as well.

Here we'll use the [webNavigation API] and its `onCommitted`,
`onHistoryStateUpdated` and `onReferenceFragmentUpdated` events to listen for
user navigation.

```
browser.webNavigation.onCommitted.addListener(evt => {
  ...
})
```

Also, we'll need to be able to detect when the user is navigating using history
by testing whether `webNavigation.TransitionQualifier` is `'forward_back'`.




## User Navigation Types

`webNavigation.TransitionQualifier` `"from_address_bar"` and
`webNavigation.TransitionType` `"typed"`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference between `webNavigation.TransitionQualifier === "from_address_bar"`
and `webNavigation.TransitionType === "typed"`.

* `TransitionType === 'typed'` indicates how navigation started. User *typed* a
  URL directly into the address bar.
* `TransitionQualifier === 'from_address_bar'` indicates extra detail.
  Navigation originated *from* the address bar, regardless of how (typed,
  search, or history dropdown).

**Key Takeaway:** If it's `typed`, it's also `from_address_bar`. But if it's
`from_address_bar`, it's not necessarily `typed` (could be a search, or
selecting a history item from the address bar dropdown).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When `TransitionQualifier === 'from_address_bar'` the following
`TransitionType` values are possible in the `webNavigation.onCommitted` event:

The key is that `from_address_bar` is a **qualifier** that specifies *where the
navigation originated*, while `transitionType` tells you *what kind of
navigation* it was.

* `typed`: This is the most common and direct combination. The user explicitly
  typed a URL into the address bar and pressed Enter, or selected a direct URL
  suggestion from the address bar's dropdown.
* `generated`: This occurs when the user starts typing in the address bar, and
  then clicks on a suggested entry that is **not a direct URL**. This often
  happens with search queries (e.g., typing "weather" and then the browser
  generates a search URL like `google.com/search?q=weather`). Even though a
  search query was entered, the navigation originated *from* the address bar.
* `auto_bookmark`: If the user selects a bookmark from the address bar's
  autocomplete suggestions (or perhaps a history item that was originally a
  bookmark), the `transitionType` could be `auto_bookmark`, while the
  `transitionQualifiers` would include `from_address_bar` because the action
  started there.
* `reload`: If the user reloads the page by pressing Enter in the address bar
  (after the URL is already there), the `transitionType` would be `reload`, and
  `transitionQualifiers` would include `from_address_bar`. This also applies to
  session restore or reopening closed tabs, where the navigation is treated as
  a reload originating from the address bar's context.

---

In summary:

* `typed` is the most direct consequence of using the address bar to navigate to a specific URL.
* `generated` covers using the address bar for searches.
* `auto_bookmark` covers using the address bar to select a bookmark.
* `reload` covers re-submitting the current URL from the address bar.



# Problems

[Browser Restart]: #browser-restart
## Browser Restart

On browser restart, all existing windows and tabs need to be reassociated to
their history state.

Here's a [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14518800/351162)
discussing how to do this in Chrome (but it is applicable to Firefox as well):

> Tabs can be (almost) uniquely and consistently identified as
> required by the question by maintaining a register of tabs which stores the
> following combination of variables in local persistent storage:
>
> - `Tab.id`
> - `Tab.index`
> - A 'fingerprint' of the document open in the tab - `[location.href, document.referrer, history.length]`
>
> These variables can be tracked and stored in the registry using listeners on
> a combination of the following events: `onUpdated` / `onCreated` / `onMoved`
> / `onDetached` / `onAttached` / `onRemoved` / `onReplaced`
>
> <p><p>There are still ways to fool this method, but in practice they are
> probably pretty rare - mostly edge cases.
>
> Since it looks like I'm not the only one who has needed to solve this

## Detecting History Navigation

In order to maintain it's internal state of history, Rewin needs to be able to
distinguish when the user navigates by following a link, from when history is
used to navigate.

The [webNavigation API] can be used to figure out what kind of user interaction
was used to navigate to a new URL.

With `webNavigation.TransitionQualifier` `'forward_back'`


[Browser History Menu]: #browser-history-menu
## Browser History Menu

Functions used to populate a tab's browser history *only sometimes* affect the
history menus of the "Back" (←) and "Forward" (→) buttons in the browser.
However, this is not the programmatic view---from inside the extension,
updating the history works just fine---it is just the state is not shown in the
browser menus.

What's even more frustrating is that the above is *not always the case.* I've
tried to figure out what causes the weird behavior, thinking that it might be
tied to Firefox's [features gated by user activation], or the limitation for
[when popstate is sent] that suppresses popstate events if the user haven't yet
interacted with the tab in question, however, this does not seem to be the
case.---Or, if it is, then that is only part of the story.


### When it Works

The browser `history` state seems to always be consistent from inside
Javascript. Loading a new page, or using `pushState()` always increases
`history.length` by one, regardless of whether an entry is added to the Back
button menu or not, and the navigation methods (`back()`, `forward()` and
`go()`) always take you to the place you expect, regardless of whether that
history entry is visible in the browser menu or not.

I *think* the above is true regardless of what method is used to navigate,
though I have mostly experimented using `pushState()`---but it seems to me that
navigation based on `location` or `browser.tabs` have demonstrated the same
behavior.

In the instances I have been able to update the Back button menus, this has
always been triggered by user interaction. For example, displaying a button on
the web page itself, and have that call a function that does repeated
`pushState()` *sometimes* work to update browser Back button menu, but
sometimes not. When updating the history state from an extension, or directly
on page load, however, I have never been able to get the browser menu to
change.—It's also interesting to note that this does not seem related to the
speed with which the updates are done, using `setTimeout()` to space out the
`pushState()` invocations does not seem to affect the result one way or the
other.

Actually, that's not *entirely* true. When using `setTimeout()` and adding
history events with a long delay, the *current page* is always included in the
menu, and if the user opens the menu that current page is retained in the menu,
even after the text page is loaded. Lets say I have a Javascript that uses
`pushState()` to update the history menu with a 10 second interval. First I
load page A, this page will then be visible in the Back button menu until page
B is loaded, whereupon page B is visible in the menu until page C is loaded
(and so on). *However,* if the user happen to open the menu while (say) page B
was loaded (and then closed the menu again, without clicking any of the entries
therein) then the menu entry for page B will be retained, even after page C, D
and E have been loaded. Thus, the current page, plus any page that was loaded
when the user opened the menu will be retained in the menu.


### Restoring History

Currently, the tab history is populated with "fake" history events, which is
then loaded for real (by a content script) when a user navigate to that history
entry. The reason for this is that `history.pushState()` is used to populate
the history, and it can only be used for URLs with the same [origin] as the
current page (that is, URLs that have the same *protocol* and *domain*).

This means that history entries that have been restored by Rewin does not
contain "true" content, but a state that refers to the actual URL, and only
when the user navigates to one of these history entries, is the true content
loaded (by means of `location.replace()`).

<p><p>Different ways of loading adding an entry to history:

* [History API]---Use `pushState()` create fake history entries, then use
  content script to load the real page when user navigates to the entry.
* [Tabs API] (for browser extensions)---Use `create()` and `update()`
  methods are able to load arbitrary addresses.
* [Window location property]---Use its `assign()` or `replace()` methods.
* Link injection (insert a link into the DOM, then click it).
* Form injection (same as above, but use a form instead).
* [Proxy API]---I don't know if this is suitable. Also, it's incompatible with
  the corresponding Chrome API, so maybe avoid on the grounds that it'll make
  it harder to make a Chrome extension in the future?



# Afterword

There are so many ways one can go with this, and I'm trying not to let my
fantastical wishes run too wild.

Sometime in the future I'd like to be able to "see my own trail" across the
internet, so that if I ever revisit a web page there'll be some visual
indicator in the browser showing that I've been there before.---From there I'd
like to be able to explore the context of my previous visit, see where I came
from last I was there, see what other tabs where open at that time, and be able
to explore my past history.

Maybe even be able to leave some notes to my future self? Or at least leave
myself a thumbs up/thumbs down---indicating to my future self whether or not I
found the page useful. (I imagine a thumbs up/thumbs down emoji would replace
the current bookmark star, in the Firefox URL bar---and in practice, I'm
thinking this would just be two bookmark folders, likewise named thumbs
up/thumbs down.)

## Alternative User Interfaces

* [Lossless Web Navigation with Trails]---Argues that when link is opened in a
  new tab (or window) it should to retain all its history (as if 'Duplicate
  Tab' was clicked first). Each tab thus would have its own "trail" through the
  history, some of which would be shared with other tabs.
* [A Spacial Model for Lossless Web Navigation]---Suggests a user interface for
  navigating back and forward in history, but also "vertically" between trails.
